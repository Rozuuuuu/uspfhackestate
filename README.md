## Installation

1. Clone the repository

cd uspfhackestate
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
composer install
npm install && npm run dev
```

3. Configure environment

## Development Setup

### Git Configuration
1. Initialize the repository
```bash
git init
```

2. Add the remote repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Rozuuuuu/uspfhackestate.git
```

3. If you encounter push rejection errors, try these safer steps:
```bash
# First, create a backup of your work (just in case)
git branch backup-main

# Get the remote changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Merge the remote changes with yours
git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# If there are conflicts, resolve them in your editor
# Then commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"

# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

4. If you still have issues, try this alternative:
```bash
# Stash your changes temporarily
git stash

# Pull the remote changes
git pull origin main

# Reapply your changes
git stash pop

# Resolve any conflicts, then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Merge changes"
git push origin main
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
